# API testing(Rest Assured) and Mobile Testing with Appium Java and Appium WDIO

## Introduction
This project focuses on automating the testing of a Chess app and validating API endpoints using REST Assured, Appium, and WebdriverIO. The aim is to ensure the reliability and functionality of the app and its API services through comprehensive test automation.

## Features
### API Testing:
Implemented API tests using REST Assured to validate various endpoints.
Logged the status codes and output for each API request.

### Mobile App Testing with Appium:
Developed automated tests for the Chess app using Appium.
Implemented various user interactions such as touch, tap, scroll, and notifications handling.
Mobile App Testing with WebdriverIO:

### Configured WebdriverIO for automating mobile app tests.
Utilized Appium Inspector for locating elements and performing actions in the Chess app.

## Project Overview
## API Testing with REST Assured
Validate the API endpoints provided in the mock API at https://posthook-api.mock.beeceptor.com.  
Tools Required: REST Assured library, Spring Tool Suite or Eclipse.  
Endpoints to Validate:  
Schedule a hook  
Get a hook  
Get a hook by ID  
Update a hook  
Delete a hook by ID  
Record status codes and output for each endpoint and log results.

## Mobile Testing with Appium Java
Appium serves as the backbone for automating the testing of the Chess app through the ChessTest class. By configuring desired capabilities, Appium establishes a connection to the mobile device and allows the execution of a series of automated interactions that mimic user behavior. These interactions not only verify the functionality of the app but also ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, making Appium an invaluable tool in mobile application testing.

## Mobile Testing with Appium WedDriverIO
WebdriverIO, combined with Appium, provides a powerful framework for mobile app testing, allowing testers to create efficient, readable, and maintainable test scripts. This approach enhances test coverage and reliability, ensuring that mobile applications deliver a seamless user experience across different devices and platforms
